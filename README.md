# Microsoft365DSC

This module allows organizations to automate the deployment,
configuration, and monitoring of Microsoft 365 Tenants via PowerShell
Desired State Configuration. The compiled configuration needs to be
executed from an agent's Local Configuration Manager (LCM) (machine
or container) which can communicate back remotely to Microsoft 365 via
remote API calls (therefore requires internet connectivity)

## How to Install

In order to acquire the latest
bits of the module from a machine that has internet connectivity,
simply run the following PowerShell line:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft365DSC -Force -AllowClobber
```

## Telemetry Disclaimer

Microsoft365DSC captures Telemetry data about the names of the resources
in which a configuration drift has been detected, along with the type
of exceptions being thrown by errors in the various modules. While no
sensitive data is ever being captured, App Insights which is used for
the analytics of the Telemetry, does capture information about the city
where the telemetry entries where captured from by default. Users can
opt out to prevent telemetry to be sent back to the Microsoft365DSC team
by running the following command:

```powershell
Set-M365DSCTelemetryOption -Enabled $False
```
