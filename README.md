# Microsoft365DSC

This module allows organizations to automate the deployment, 
configuration, reporting, and monitoring of Microsoft 365 Tenants via PowerShell 
Desired State Configuration. The compiled configuration needs to be 
executed from an agent's Local Configuration Manager (LCM) (machine 
or container), which can communicate back remotely to Microsoft 365 via 
remote API calls (therefore requiring internet connectivity).

## How to Install

To acquire the latest
bits of the module from a machine that has internet connectivity,
run the following PowerShell lines:

```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft365DSC -Force
Update-M365DSCModule
```

## Telemetry Disclaimer

Microsoft365DSC captures Telemetry data about the names of the resources
in which a configuration drift has been detected, along with the type
of exceptions being thrown by errors in the various modules. While no
sensitive data is ever captured, App Insights, which performs
telemetry analytics, captures information about the city
where the telemetry entries were captured by default. Users can
opt-out to prevent telemetry from being sent back to the Microsoft365DSC team
by running the following command:

```PowerShell
Set-M365DSCTelemetryOption -Enabled $False
```
