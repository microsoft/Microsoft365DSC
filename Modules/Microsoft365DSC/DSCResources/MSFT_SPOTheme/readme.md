# SPO Theme

This resource allows users to configure and monitor the themes for
their SPO tenant.

To configure your SPO themes using this configuration resource requires you to
provide a color palette which at the end defines the colors of your theme.

You can use the SPO Theme builder under:

[https://aka.ms/spthemebuilder](https://aka.ms/spthemebuilder)

to create and preview your color palette.

Once you are satisfied with the color of your theme you can copy
the JSON Output and put it directly into your configuration.

More details on the theme schema can be found
