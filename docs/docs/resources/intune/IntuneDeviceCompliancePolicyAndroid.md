# IntuneAndroidDeviceCompliancePolicy
## Description

This resource configures the settings of Android device compliance policies
in your cloud-based organization.

## Parameters

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

* **Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score**
  Select the maximum allowed machine risk score for devices evaluated by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Devices that exceed this score get marked as noncompliant.
    * Not configured (_default_)
    * Clear
    * Low
    * Medium
    * High

### Device Health

* **Devices managed with device administrator**
  Device administrator capabilities are superseded by Android Enterprise.
    * Not configured (_default_)
    * Block - Blocking device administrator will guide users to move to Android Enterprise Personally-Owned and Corporate-Owned Work Profile management to regain access.

### Rooted devices
* **Prevent rooted devices from having corporate access. (This compliance check is supported for Android 4.0 and above.)**
    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Block - Mark rooted (jailbroken) devices as not compliant.

* **Require the device to be at or under the Device Threat Level**
  Use this setting to take the risk assessment from a connected Mobile Threat Defense service as a condition for compliance.
    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Secured - This option is the most secure, as the device can't have any threats. If the device is detected with any level of threats, it's evaluated as noncompliant.
    * Low - The device is evaluated as compliant if only low-level threats are present. Anything higher puts the device in a noncompliant status.
    * Medium - The device is evaluated as compliant if existing threats on the device are low or medium level. If the device is detected to have high-level threats, it's determined to be noncompliant.
    * High - This option is the least secure, and allows all threat levels. It may be useful if you're using this solution only for reporting purposes.

### Google Play Protect
* **Google Play Services is configured**
  Google Play services allows security updates, and is a base-level dependency for many security features on certified-Google devices.
    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Require - Require that the Google Play services app is installed and enabled.

* **Up-to-date security provider**
    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Require - Require that an up-to-date security provider can protect a device from known vulnerabilities.

* **Threat scan on apps**
    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Require - Require that the Android Verify Apps feature is enabled.

* **SafetyNet device attestation**
  Enter the level of SafetyNet attestation that must be met. Your options:
    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Check basic integrity
    * Check basic integrity & certified devices

### Device Properties
* **Operating System Version**
    * Minimum OS version
  When a device doesn't meet the minimum OS version requirement, it's reported as noncompliant. A link with information about how to upgrade is shown. The end user can choose to upgrade their device, and then get access to company resources.

  _By default, no version is configured._

    * Maximum OS version
  When a device is using an OS version later than the version specified in the rule, access to company resources is blocked. The user is asked to contact their IT admin. Until a rule is changed to allow the OS version, this device can't access company resources.

  _By default, no version is configured._

### System Security
* **Encryption**
  Encryption of data storage on a device
  Supported on Android 4.0 and later, or KNOX 4.0 and later.
    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Require - Encrypt data storage on your devices. Devices are encrypted when you choose the Require a password to unlock mobile devices setting.

* **Device Security**
  Block apps from unknown sources
  Supported on Android 4.0 to Android 7.x. Not supported by Android 8.0 and later
    * Not configured (_default_) - this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Block - Block devices with Security > Unknown Sources enabled sources (_supported on Android 4.0 through Android 7.x. Not supported on Android 8.0 and later._).

  To side-load apps, unknown sources must be allowed. If you're not side-loading Android apps, then set this feature to Block to enable this compliance policy.

* **Company portal app runtime integrity**
    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Require - Choose Require to confirm the Company Portal app meets all the following requirements:
        * Has the default runtime environment installed
        * Is properly signed
        * Isn't in debug-mode

* **Block USB debugging on device**
  _(Supported on Android 4.2 or later)_

    * Not configured (_default_) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Block - Prevent devices from using the USB debugging feature.

* **Minimum security patch level**
  _(Supported on Android 6.0 or later)_

  Select the oldest security patch level a device can have. Devices that aren't at least at this patch level are noncompliant. The date must be entered in the YYYY-MM-DD format.

  _By default, no date is configured._

* **Restricted apps**
  Enter the App name and App bundle ID for apps that should be restricted, and then select Add. A device with at least one restricted app installed is marked as non-compliant.

### Password

The available settings for passwords vary by the version of Android on the device.

#### All Android devices
The following settings are supported on Android 4.0 or later, and Knox 4.0 and later.

* **Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required**

  Specify the required password complexity.
    * None (_default_) - No password required.
    * Low - The password satisfies one of the following conditions:
        * Pattern
        * Numeric PIN has a repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequence.
    * Medium - The password satisfies one of the following conditions:
        * Numeric PIN doesnâ€™t have a repeating (4444) or ordered (1234, 4321, 2468) sequence, and has minimum length of 4.
        * Alphabetic, with a minimum length of 4.
        * Alphanumeric, with a minimum length of 4.
    * High - The password satisfies one of the following conditions:

    * Require - Users must enter a password before they can access their device.

When set to Require, the following setting can be configured:

* **Required password type**
  Choose if a password should include only numeric characters, or a mix of numerals and other characters.
    * Device Default - To evaluate password compliance, be sure to select a password strength other than Device default.
    * Low security biometric
    * At least numeric
    * Numeric complex - Repeated or consecutive numerals, such as 1111 or 1234, aren't allowed.
    * At least alphabetic
    * At least alphanumeric
    * At least alphanumeric with symbols

  Based on the configuration of this setting, one or more of the following options are available:
    * Minimum password length
    Enter the minimum number of digits or characters that the user's password must have.
    * Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required
    Enter the idle time before the user must reenter their password. When you choose Not configured (_default_), this setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance.
    * Number of days until password expires
    Select the number of days before the password expires and the user must create a new password.
    * Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse
