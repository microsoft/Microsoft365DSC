## Description

The TeamsCallParkPolicy controls whether or not users are able to leverage the call park feature in Microsoft Teams. Call park allows enterprise voice customers to place a call on hold and then perform a number of actions on that call: transfer to another department, retrieve via the same phone, or retrieve via a different Teams phone. The New-CsTeamsCallParkPolicy resource lets you create a new custom policy that can then be assigned to one or more specific users.
