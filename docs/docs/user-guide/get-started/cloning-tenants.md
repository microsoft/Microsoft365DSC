This feature of Microsoft365DSC is not a true standalone feature. It is a combination of existing features to unlock a new scenario for users.

## Clone = Export/Deploy
Since Microsoft365DSC is able to take a snapshot of any Microsoft 365 tenant and can deploy a Microsoft365DSC configuration onto any tenant, we can easily clone the configuration of any tenant over another one (or another set of tenants).

When you take a snapshot of an existing tenant, the extracted configuration file doesnâ€™t contain any information that is specific to the source tenant. It abstracts it all into variables, which make the configuration generic instead of unique for a particular tenant. It is then at compilation time that you provide information about the environment onto which this configuration will be applied to.

***For example:***

Let's assume you are trying to clone the configuration of Tenant A onto Tenant B. You would start by capturing the existing configuration of tenant A using credentials or a Service Principal that exists and has rights on Tenant A. This will generate the configuration file containing all the configuration settings for Tenant A. Then at compilation time, when trying to compile the extracted configuration into a MOF file, you will need to provide credentials or a Service Principal that has access to Tenant B. Then all that is left to do is to deploy the configuration onto Tenant B to have all the configurations settings from tenant A applied onto it.
