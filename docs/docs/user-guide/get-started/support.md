As mentioned on the [Introduction](../introduction) page, Microsoft365DSC is an open-source solution led by Microsoft engineers and maintained by the community. This means that it is not supported via regular Microsoft support channels.

If you need help getting started, want to report a bug or request new features to be added, you will need to use the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft365DSC/issues" target="_blank">Issues</a> section of the official <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft365DSC" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository to do so.

The team is meeting on a weekly basis to review items and prioritize fixes. If you require immediate attention for a blocking issue and you have a Premier or Unified support contract with Microsoft, you can always talk to your account team to leverage hours in your contract to have a Customer Engineer assigned to expedite the process.
