Microsoft365DSC takes all its sense when used as part of DevOps processes within the enterprise. You can use it to automate your Microsoft 365 Change Management process so that any requested configuration changes to tenants get tracked via systems like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops" target="_blank">Azure DevOps</a> or <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and use them to automate the deployment of your changes across your various tenants when a change is approved.
